# PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
Develop a machine learning model to help TechWorks Consulting determine the salary of newly hired employees using the provided data.

## Description:
TechWorks Consulting is a prominent consulting firm that excels in supplying top-tier IT talent to various businesses. The company prides itself on swiftly and effectively matching highly skilled IT professionals with suitable job positions. Founded by a group of seasoned IT experts, TechWorks Consulting was born from a desire to improve the traditional job search process, which is often slow and inefficient. They envisioned a company that could revolutionize the way IT talent is placed in jobs.

The firm has a distinct approach to sourcing and placing IT professionals, boasting a vast and continually expanding database of qualified candidates. This database is built through networking, referrals, and targeted recruiting efforts. Their team of skilled recruiters excels at identifying the most suitable candidates for any given position. This unique strategy has propelled TechWorks Consulting to become one of the leading IT staffing companies in the nation. From small startups to large corporations, businesses of all sizes rely on TechWorks Consulting to find the IT talent they need to thrive.

TechWorks Consulting is particularly renowned for its ability to fulfill large-scale hiring needs in a short timeframe, often working with companies that are rapidly growing and require a significant influx of IT professionals quickly. The company handles these large-scale projects efficiently due to its extensive database of candidates and experienced recruitment team.

Continuing to set the standard for IT staffing and consulting, TechWorks Consulting is a trusted partner for businesses seeking top IT talent, and for IT professionals looking for the right job opportunities. As the company expands its services and domains, it continues to be a highly sought-after consulting firm in the industry.

One critical factor in the company's success is its commitment to offering fair and competitive salaries. TechWorks Consulting considers multiple factors when determining salaries, such as an employee's experience, qualifications, and performance. Market rates for specific roles and skill sets are also considered to ensure that the offered compensation is competitive within the industry. This approach helps attract and retain top talent.

In addition to market rates, TechWorks Consulting evaluates the specific skills and experience of potential hires. Employees with more experience or specialized skills may receive higher salaries than those new to the field. The company also takes into account current market trends and the cost of living in the employee's work location, making their salary packages adaptable to market changes.

Employee performance is another key consideration in salary determination. TechWorks Consulting uses performance evaluation systems to assess the value and contributions of employees, with potential for salary increases based on performance. Overall, the company strives to ensure that its compensation packages are competitive and fair, based on various relevant factors.

## The provided data includes the following 8 columns:

* College Name: Colleges are categorized into three groups—Tier1, Tier2, and Tier3—with Tier1 colleges having the highest weightage.
* City: The city data includes two categories: metro and non-metro. For numerical conversion, 0 should represent non-metro cities, and 1 should represent metro cities.
* Role: This column includes roles such as Manager and Executive.
* Other columns include Previous CTC, Previous Job Change, Graduation Marks, Experience in Months, and CTC.
* Regression Task: Machine learning, specifically regression, can play a crucial role for TechWorks Consulting in predicting employee salaries. Regression is a technique used to forecast continuous values, such as salary, based on historical data. TechWorks Consulting can leverage past employee data, including qualifications, experience, performance, and salary, to train a regression model. This model can then predict salaries for new hires based on their qualifications, experience, and other relevant factors.

The company can use a variety of features as inputs to the model, such as education level, past job experience, certifications, and location. The model learns the relationship between these features and employee salaries. Using machine learning to predict salaries ensures that compensation decisions are consistent and data-driven, rather than based on subjective judgments. Additionally, machine learning models can make faster and more accurate predictions compared to manual methods, especially as data volumes grow, saving time and enhancing decision-making.

It's important to note that the effectiveness of a machine learning model depends on the quality of the training data and the chosen features. Therefore, TechWorks Consulting should ensure their historical data is comprehensive and accurate. Additionally, having machine learning and statistics experts on the team can help refine the model for better predictions.

Statistics and Data Pre-Processing: Statistics play a vital role in developing and evaluating regression models. Statisticians analyze the data to understand the distribution of salaries and other features and investigate the correlation between features and the target variable (salary). They also use statistical techniques for feature selection, such as Lasso, Ridge, and PCA, to identify the most important features for the regression model.

Once the model is trained, statisticians evaluate its performance using statistical metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average difference between predicted and actual salaries. A lower MSE indicates better model accuracy. Other metrics such as R-Squared and AIC can also be used for model evaluation. Additionally, hypothesis testing can be used to assess the significance of model coefficients, ensuring the results are robust and not due to chance.

Data pre-processing is another critical step in developing regression models for salary prediction at TechWorks Consulting. Pre-processing involves cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for model training.
## Data pre-processing include:

* Handling Missing Values: Deciding whether to remove missing data or fill in gaps using imputation techniques.
* Handling Outliers: Identifying and addressing outliers to prevent them from skewing model predictions.
* Handling Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables (e.g., education level, job titles) into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
* Normalization: Scaling feature values to the same range to prevent any feature from dominating the others.
* Feature Selection: Choosing the most important features for the regression model.
Data pre-processing is iterative, and statisticians may need to test various techniques to find the best approach for the data and problem. Proper data pre-processing ensures that the regression model is trained on high-quality data, improving prediction accuracy and preventing issues like overfitting and bias.

## Task: 
As a data analyst at TechWorks Consulting, your task is to create a machine learning model to predict the salaries of newly hired employees using the given data. Outline your approach and perform the necessary steps to make accurate predictions, including data preparation. For instance, convert the college field into a numerical type based on the college tier, similarly convert the city field, and create dummy variables for the "Role" column. Identify and clean outliers and missing values, and once the data is ready, build a predictive model. You can experiment with multiple regression models and choose the one with the best accuracy, explaining why it performed better than the others and suggesting ways to further improve the selected model's accuracy.

## Views on the Problem Statement: What will be your approach to solving this task? What machine learning model options do you have for this task? Which model performed best, and why? What steps can be taken to further enhance the performance of the selected model?
