The choice of the model depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, the complexity of the problem, the need for model interpretability, and lastly the performance of the model. Here are some of the available ML model options:\n","**1. Linear Regression:**\n","- Linear regression is a simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (salary). It's a good starting point and can provide baseline performance.\n","\n","**2. Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:**\n","- Ridge and Lasso regression are regularization techniques that can be used to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. They are variants of linear regression that add regularization terms to the cost function.\n","\n","**3. Decision Trees:**\n","- Decision tree-based models, like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data. They can handle both numerical and categorical features and automatically deal with feature importance.\n","\n","**4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**\n","- KNN is a non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the average of the 'k' nearest data points. It can be effective for small to medium-sized datasets.\n","\n","**5. Polynomial Regression:**\n","- Polynomial regression can be used to capture non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial features.\n","\n","From these 5 models, I will be performing only 3 of them with default parameters and with somes changes in parameter. First I will use these models in four different scenarios and then will decide which model will be best for this task.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"40404809-4398-4bfd-96be-11c674cfa537","metadata":{"id":"40404809-4398-4bfd-96be-11c674cfa537"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the pandas
